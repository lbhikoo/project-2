      "location": "Anchorage, Alaska",
      "todo": "Ride the Rails: The railroad is what gave Anchorage its start and first linked the broad stretches of Alaska together. The train that travels from Anchorage to Seward and back again is a particularly beautiful trip. The 3.5 hour trip is riddled with gorgeous coastal views and perhaps even some wildlife! \nWitness History: Every year a ceremonial start of the legendary Iditarod race takes place in Anchorage on the Fourth Avenue at D street. It runs all the way to the Campbell Creek Science Center. The next day the Iditarod mushers begin the true race in Willow and end in Nome. The event is roughly 1,000 miles. \nNorthern Lights: Just outside of Anchorage, away from the city lights, if you're lucky, you may catch a glimppse of the glorious Aurora Borealis. Keep your eyes peeled, it's not something you'd want to miss.",
      "food": "Berries: The fresh berries that grow in Alaska are incredibly delectable. My personal favorites include strawberries, blueberries, and raspberries. You can find them in the wilds of Alaska or perhaps even in your backyard. \nReindeer sausage: The reindeer sausage that can be found all around Anchorage is absolutely legendary. One of my all time favorite Anchorage street foods is a classic reindeer sausage hotdog with ketchup, mustard, and relish. Make sure to try it if you get the chance. \nSeafood: Alaska is known worldwide for its great seafood. It is particularly known for its King Crab, Salmon, Oysters, and Halibut. There's certainly more but that's a good place to start. It's safe to say, if you're looking for a top notch seafood experience, look no further than the rugged and majestic lands of Alaska.",
      "hotel": "Alyseka Ski Resort: The Alyeska Resort is located in Girdwood which is roughly 30 minutes outside of Anchorage. It is nestled at the base of a mountain where you can see hundreds of people skiing and snowboarding on a daily basis. Halfway  up the mountain, accessible by tram, is a beautiful restaurant that, speaking from experience, serves absolutely delicious food. The hotel itself is cozy, large, and hosts a number of restaurants as well as skii equipment. \nHotel Captain Cook: This Hotel is one of the tallest buildings in Anchorage. It houses perhaps the fanciest restaurant in Anchorage at its peak, Crowes Nest. It has 546 rooms, roughly 100 of which are suites. At the base of the hotel is the Hotel Captain Cook restaurant. I've heard it's great but haven't gone there myself.",
      "history": "A bit of history: Alaska was a Russian Colony from 1744 until the USA purchased it in 1867 for a measly $7,200,000. It wasn't until 1959 that Alaska became a state. Only 5 years later a 9.2 magnitude earthquake rocked the Prince William Sound, killing 131 people and abosultely devastating surrounding cities and towns, including Anchorage. By 1973 the first official Iditarod race was run. Around the same time, 1968, oil was discovered in PrudhoeBay. With the completion of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline in 1977 an oil boom occurred. Shortly after this the first dividened checks were distributed to the residents of Alaska. Since the Discovery of oil, Alaska has seen a constant battle between those who wish to preserve the land and those who wish to mine it for its resources.",

      "todo": "Karnak Temple Complex: The Karnak Temple is a massive temple complex to which dozens of pharaohs added their own constructions. The immense size of the complex, as well as its various architectural, artistic, and linguistic details make it an invaluable historical site and resource for understanding the evolution of ancient Egypt, and thus its conservation is critical., Luxor Temple: Constructed over hundreds of years by Amenhotep III, Ramses II, Tutankhamun, and other pharaohs, Luxor Temple was the largest and most significant religious center in ancient Egypt. Today, remains of this vast complex include the colossal Great Colonnade Hall, almost 61 meters long, with 28 twenty-one-foot-high columns, its decoration largely undertaken by Tutankhamun around 1330 B.C., Mummification Museum: Mummification museum in Luxor (ancient Thebes), intended to provide an understanding of the process to preserve the body.

Atop the mountains you'll find stone ruins which are a blast to explore. Also, atop these mountains, you'll find cows and horses wandering freely. They don't pay you any mind unless you pester them. Essentially, are you looking for an adventure? Look no further than the Sacred Valley of Peru. In fact, just check out all of Peru. It's a pretty awesome place. \"",
